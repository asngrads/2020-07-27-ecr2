Bioinformatics is an essential component of modern genomics research. These computer-intensive methods are often difficult to learn for many without guidance from experienced individuals. In turn, graduate students and early-career researchers at institutions with limited bioinformatics resources are at a disadvantage toward the use of these and other emerging tools in evolutionary biology.

As part of <b><a href="https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/ecr2.html">Evolutionary Community Responses for Early Career Researchers (ECR<sup>2</sup>) 2020</a></b>, the American Society of Naturalists' Graduate Council is hosting a <b>Command-Line Bioinformatics for Beginners Workshop</b> on July 27-28th, 2020. This workshop is free for all members of the American Society of Naturalists (ASN), Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), or Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB). Applicants with no previous experience with bioinformatics tools and/or command-line programming will be prioritized.

This workshop is based on exercises from the Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop. <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience,and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

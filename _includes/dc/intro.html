Bioinformatics is an essential component of modern genomics research. These computer-intensive methods are often difficult to learn without guidance by experienced individuals. In turn, graduate students and early-career researchers at institutions with limited bioinformatics resources are at a disadvantage toward using these and other emerging tools in evolutionary biology. As part of the Evolutionary Community Response to Early Career Researchers (ECR <sup>2</sup>) 2020, the American Society of Naturalists (ASN) Graduate Council is hosting a virtual workshop on July 27-28th, 2020 about introductory bioformatics tools and command-line programming. This workshop is open to all ASN members, however applicants with no previous experience with bioinformatics tools and/or command-line programming will be prioritized.

  This workshop is based on exercises from the Data Carpentry Genomics Workshop. <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a>
  develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct
  research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, 
  and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly 
  apply skills learned to their own research.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. For additional information about the Data Carpentry Genomics
